1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The following story will be about an easy-chair. 

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As Péter Váró said at the beginning (of the presentation series) 

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
if we look at objects differently, they can change or they will change. 

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is anyone here thinks about this easy-chair as something other than a chair? 

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here, look. Like drop of water or something. 

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I won't give the answer away. This is an association game, what comes to your mind when you look at it?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
(somebody shouts from the back rows)

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Say what? Ok, I think we should hear the story

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
from the designer who had a simple problem and found a very simple solution to it 

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He just wanted to sit down, but there was nothing to sit down on. So he did something about it. 

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The next presenter is Géza Csire.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Three years ago, I finished my university studies and I had to move out of the dormitory. 

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And I moved into... this

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As an upstart designer this itsy bitsy odd looking green room annoyed me greatly

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and I felt really bad that this is all I can afford. 

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, I decided that my first project as a designer 

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
will be to revamp this room. I started with the walls, of course. 

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
After that, because there were no lampshades I decided to install a chrome hemisphere lamp 

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that is going to cut it. It would look great in this environment. 

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I went to IKEA to buy one and thought it will be awesome. 

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Unfortunately, as I have reached the lamp section I realized I cannot afford to buy any of them. 

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As I was leaving I  have stumbled upon some salad bowls, 

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
chrome hemisphere salad bowls.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They were way cheaper, so I bought one, I drilled a hole at the bottom and I had the lamp of my dreams. 

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Exalted by my success, I made a curtain valance from a broomstick. 

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Necessity inspires, doesn't it? 

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was given a matters so I don't have to sleep on the floor. 

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I really didn't like it at all.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was ugly. If I had a guest it needed to be put away or I had to make the bed, which I don't like either. 

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I thought I have my next challenge to turn it into an armchair. 

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, I started thinking about it. 

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I put a big sheet of paper on the wall and I started to drew all kinds of tricky mechanisms onto it. 

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I thought long and hard and I was proud of myself for thinking of so many different things. 

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But none of it came through. After two months it seemed everything would need drilling and carving. 

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I would have to be precise and buy more stuff to make them. 

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This seemed too much and I wanted a simple solution. 

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I started giving up thinking it might not even have a slick solution. 

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The place where I lived was not only small, but it was also very far from the city center. 

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have spent almost two hours commuting every day. That was a lot. 

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I thought it was to much to just let it got to waste, 

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
therefore, I started different projects. For instance, drawing the strangers I was traveling with 

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and everything that they reminded me of.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Some people gave me business cards, and were happy about it, some people lashed out at me, saying I had not right to draw their portraits. 

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, I moved on to a different project. I started folding different kinds of objects. 

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My first thought was whether I could fold a cylinder and break it in a 90 degree angle, 

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
without having to cut the paper so I won't cockle it, 

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
instead I would get a sort of cylinder along the fold.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I took a piece of paper, rectangle shaped, and folded it along the side to get a cylinder 

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and as an experiment I pressed in one of the sides. 

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I looked at it: this is a chair. If it was big enough, I could sit on it. 

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
While opening it would give me a bed. 

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, I got off the tram and I went into a draper's shop. 

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I bought some dot snaps because it takes only a hammer to attach them, 

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I affixed them onto the edge of my mattress cover 

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and there you have it, the first prototype of my easy-chair. 

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I made this grey version later. 

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I loved it very much because I didn't need to make my bed ever again. 

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
More than that if anyone came to visit and my room wasn't tidy, I could take all my stuff and put them inside the bed. 

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I rolled it up and the room was tidy.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It wasn't the first object I made. During my university studies I entered into competitions with a shelf and a lamp 

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Both of them won the LG design award, so I wrote my thesis working with them. 

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
For that the Hungarian TV sought me out. They wanted to come to my place and film in my room 

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
because I could show them interesting things. 

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I thought it would be great. I could show them my chair

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
then it would immediately become a product.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For my thesis work was also a chair, and people often contact me because of that. This chair became famous on the internet 

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and these people say they could set up a production line, and things like that. But as long as I don't have a prototype I can't negotiate with companies.  

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
For it is hard to sell if they can't sit on it. 

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, these things get stuck, however, the easy-chair already has a prototype so I can turn into a product immediately. 

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This chair could be transformed into a table

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and these tables could be put next to one another to make a different table or form blocks like this. 

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Moreover, they could be arranged in different styles. 

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, it is an interesting concept that became famous for a good reason. 

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But I did not have the time or the energy to make one, so I started experimenting with the easy-chair. 

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
However, nobody sought me out, no investors, no manufacturers who would be interested in selling this product. 

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In the meantime, Péter Molnár and I founded the Maform design studio.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
As we didn't know what to do with this studio, 

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
we took every opportunity we could get.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Among them was the competition of Misker Festival in Belgrad for real "balkanian" ideas. I sent them this. 

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They loved it and replied immediately, asking me to send them one because 

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
they want to present it on an exhibition in two months time.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I had this dilemma, I was happy that they wanted to exhibit it, 

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but if I gave them my easy-chair, then...

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't want to sleep on the floor.

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, I started looking for a manufacturer, to make another one for me, 

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to sew a zipper on the side of a foam mattress. 

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000 
I didn't want to carry it around in sheets. They couldn't understand what I wanted from my emails, it was difficult to communicate via telephone,

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and they didn't believe that it makes any sense based on the photos either.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, I had to take it with me to show them what it was about.

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wanted to leave the sheets at home hence I bought a flowerpot, 

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
which would substitute for the sheets, besides I could roll the whole mattress into it. 

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I got it on my back and went off to find manufacturers

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
who would sew a zipper on it. I received different offers from 40-50 thousand HUF.

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
50 thousand HUF to sew this onto that.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was scratching my head, what were they thinking?

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So, I looked far and wide till I ended up at small dressmaker's in Vác. 

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where they finally understood that I just wanted to have a zipper sewed on the side of this mattress.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
However, I came face to face with another problem, a pedantic seamstress. 

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It came in handy that I had to deal with people like this before because of the competitions, 

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
mechanics or people working in different fields.

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When I have sent the rendering of the shelf I designed to the mechanic in pdf.

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This was only the first page of the pdf - and the rest -

103
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The rest contained the technical documentation, how to make it, how it will become a good shelf.

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The mechanic sent it back and said he can't do it based on a render. 

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I told him to look at the rest of the pages, but he kept failing to realize that they were there. 

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
After a week's arguing I had to print it and send it to him. 

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Somehow, he saw more than the first page now. 

108
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Otherwise he's a good mechanic, obviously it's not his fault that he can't deal with these things. 

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For my next design project I started with sending the printed documentation. 

110
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They sent it back saying they would have to build a gigantic device to be able to make it, 

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and they couldn't afford such an expense for this project. 

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I sent them a crude drawing explaining them 

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that each element could be pulled on a cone, and there they have it. 

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then they sent it back to me saying if it is indeed so simple I should do it. 

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I did. Luckily, I am persistent in these matters.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I had these problems during my university years too. 

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I designed a clock that has a hole in the middle where circles rotate inside one another. 

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Nobody believed that it could work, or it could hold together and somehow work out 

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Everybody wanted me to change it and I got fed up. 

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
One evening I cut up some beer cans after I drunk their contents. 

121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I folded them into nice little cylinders and used them to demonstrate how the clock works. 

122
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
When they finally understood that it is actually a good idea they used a 3D-printer to make a working prototype of this clock for me. 

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I hope this will become a product someday too.

124
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So, I fought my way through fusspots like these, and the seamstress was not my first one.

125
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She said this can not be done.

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I asked: why? It won't fit into the sewing machine, there are no sewing patterns like this, it won't work, it can't work. 

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We argued a day or so, I insisted that it can be done. 

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
At the end of the day, I said: let me use the sewing machine and I will do it. 

129
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then she said that I can't touch her machines. 

130
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, she did what I asked and the very first prototype was made. 

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Later, I realized that it would be more stable if the zipper ran further up. 

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I returned to the seamstress for the modifications and

133
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
when she looked at it she said she did not make it. 

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is not possible, something like this can't be done. She swore it wasn't her work.

135
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She is an interesting person.

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Fortunately, we got past her. I changed the flowerpot to cardboard barrel in the middle. 

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This version was ready in time for the competition in Belgrade and won an innovation award there. 

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I thought this would immediately turn into a product.

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It has been awarded, there will be someone who wants to market it. 

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
However, it took another year before it became known.

141
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I needed a name for it,

142
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
"paq" because it is compact, fun-packed, and so on.

143
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Besides, p-a-q upside down is b-e-d.

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Even the logo can be turned into a bed.

145
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
After one year's work the BBDM Design Management took the product under their wings. 

146
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They organized proper manufacturing and distribution channels. 

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We tested it with many people 

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to see what they use it for. It turned out that the target audience is not really university students,

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and it will be popular rather as a spare bed.

150
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We put on the finishing touches at lunched the product at the end of April. 

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Since April distributors approached us from 11 countries. 

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This product is on sale in America, Canada, Singapore and Japan. 

153
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was slack-jawed with awe that this product became so popular overnight. 

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For example in one of the TEDx-s in Los Angeles, all the participants listen to the presentations from chairs like this. 

155
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It became successful and I started thinking about the reason why. 

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How could it become so successful so fast? What is the secret? 

157
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then it occurred to me that we all like stories, and every object has one. 

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These objects tell a story in one way or anther, which can be long or short. 

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The story of my easy-chair, with the empty room, the necessity, the struggles I had, 

160
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
are so deeply entwined with this object as these few slides illustrate it.

161
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We like those stories that are new, interesting, surprising, or just make us think. 

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And the really successful objects tell stories like this in a way we never heard before. 

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If I want to sit down, I rather sit on the floor than start thinking about stories. 

165
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How do these stories come to your mind?

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How do they come to my mind?

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They don't. What happens is that

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I explore, experiment, I allow my brain to wander about what interest me. 

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't let my pre-existing knowledge to be my reference point.

170
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
From things you know, you can make things you know.

171
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Instead I try to explore what is interesting, what might be new. 

172
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not new all the time, therefore, not all my ideas are inventions obviously.

173
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There are boundaries, because I too started fiddling with mechanisms at first, 

174
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
a bunch of constructive, geometric doo-hickeys that resulted chairs 

175
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
following the topology of the already existing ones.

176
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
In contrast to this, the inspiration came from a different field, origami. 

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So, I rather just saw the solution than found out something great. 

178
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I hope we will see many of your solutions in the future, 

179
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
let it be here or in other parts of the town.

180
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you for being here.

181
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
